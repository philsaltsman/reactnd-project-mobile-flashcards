# Short description:  
A fun flash card game you can use to build decks of cards, each card customized with your questions/answers and test your yourself with your created cards/decks. 

## Description
This is a mobile flash card game you can use to create decks of cards for quizzing purposes.  During an active quiz which is a random pull of cards from created decks, you will be asked a question, able to check the answer and input whether you were correct or not to help you track how well your doing.  If no longer have use for a deck, you may delete it.  Individual card editing within a deck is not yet possible in this current version.  After a single quiz is completed for the day, no notification reminder will display for that day reminding you to study!
